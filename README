@about    This is a Twilio-powered PHP script that allows a user to plug in a
          phone number and get directions. It's not practical for large-scale
          application use. It's meant for people like me who don't have a GPS
          on their lame only-texting-not-very-smart-phone to get some directions
          in a pinch.

@install  Edit config.inc.php, and point twilio's SMS address to http://mydomain.com/textgps/receive.php

@usage    My parsing isn't even really parsing. It's super dumb. Super super dumb.
          Street names with spaces in them won't work. I could improve it, but
          this was a spur-of-the-moment night project, so it's your problem if you
          want something more complex. Currently you plug in your configs and send
          a text message in this format

          Format:
            NUM STREETNAME STREETINITIAL TOWN STATE NUM STREETNAME STREETINITIAL TOWN STATE

          Example:
            1 Easton St Boston MA 22 Harvard St Boston MA

          It's not case sensitive, and you can use street instead of
          st, or drive instead of dr. Or vice versa.

@bugs     1.27.11 - Twilio sometimes sends them in the wrong order. it's
          okay because I numbered them, but it's not optimal.
